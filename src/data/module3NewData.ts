[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]
Yo! So you\'re probably here because you asked ChatGPT "tell me about consulting" and it gave you a Wikipedia article that put you to sleep, right? Meanwhile, your classmate who asked a BETTER question got actionable insights that landed them a Deloitte interview. The difference? They knew how to design prompts. And I\'m about to show you exactly how.

[PROBLEM SETUP - 0:30-1:30]
Picture this: You\'re a B.Com student. Final year. Campus placements start in 2 weeks. You\'ve got interviews lined up with Deloitte, PwC, KPMG. You\'re smart, you\'ve got decent grades (let\'s say 75%), but so do 200 other students competing for the same 10 spots.

You turn to ChatGPT for help. You ask: "How do I prepare for a consulting interview?"

And ChatGPT gives you: "Research the company. Practice common questions. Dress professionally. Be confident."

Great. Literally EVERYONE knows this. You just wasted 5 minutes getting advice your junior could have given you. This is the #1 problem - your prompt sucked. You gave ChatGPT zero context about WHO you are, WHAT role you want, or WHAT specific help you need.

[THE SOLUTION - 1:30-3:30]
Here\'s the formula that actually works:

CONTEXT + LENGTH + EXAMPLES + AUDIENCE + ROLE = Powerful Prompt

Let me break it down with a real B.Com example:

BAD PROMPT:
"Help me prepare for consulting interview"

GOOD PROMPT:
"I\'m a B.Com Finance student with strong Excel and SQL skills, applying for Business Analyst roles at Big 4 firms. I have a campus interview with Deloitte next week. I need help preparing for case interviews. Give me 3 practice cases related to retail industry profitability analysis, and show me how to structure my approach using frameworks like Porter\'s Five Forces or Value Chain Analysis. Format each case as: Scenario ‚Üí My Analysis Approach ‚Üí Key Metrics to Consider."

See the massive difference?

CONTEXT: B.Com Finance, Excel/SQL skills, Big 4 target, Deloitte specifically
LENGTH: 3 practice cases, structured format
EXAMPLES: Porter\'s Five Forces, Value Chain Analysis
AUDIENCE: For YOU, a B.Com student interviewing for Business Analyst
ROLE: ChatGPT as your case interview coach

Now ChatGPT can actually help you instead of giving generic nonsense.

[REAL SCENARIO - 3:30-5:30]
Let\'s go deeper with a real situation many B.Com students face:

You\'re prepping for Deloitte. You know they value data-driven decision making. In your Marketing Analytics course, you did a project where you segmented 10,000 customers into 5 groups based on purchasing behavior, and your recommendations helped a local retailer increase repeat purchases by 23%.

GENERIC PROMPT:
"How do I talk about my project in an interview?"

Result: Boring, generic advice like "describe what you did, mention the results, show enthusiasm."

POWERFUL PROMPT:
"I\'m interviewing for Business Analyst at Deloitte next Tuesday. In my Marketing Analytics course, I used Excel to segment 10,000 customers into 5 distinct groups based on purchasing patterns (frequency, recency, monetary value). My analysis identified that high-value customers preferred email communication over SMS, and when the retailer implemented my recommendations, repeat purchases increased 23% in 3 months. 

Help me craft a compelling 2-minute STAR-method answer that:
1. Highlights my analytical skills (customer segmentation, data analysis)
2. Shows business impact (23% increase in repeat purchases)
3. Demonstrates data-driven decision making (Deloitte\'s core value)
4. Positions me as someone who understands both data AND business outcomes

Make it conversational but professional, like I\'m explaining to a senior consultant, not reading from a script."

Now ChatGPT knows:
- The company (Deloitte) and their values (data-driven)
- Your specific project details (customer segmentation, 10K customers, 23% impact)
- What framework you want (STAR method)
- The context (Business Analyst interview)
- The tone (conversational but professional)
- The length (2 minutes)
- What to emphasize (analytical skills + business impact)

Result? You get a tailored answer you can actually use and practice.

[COMMON MISTAKES - 5:30-6:30]
Mistake #1: No Personal Context
‚ùå "Tell me about investment banking"
‚úÖ "I\'m a B.Com Finance student interested in equity research roles. I understand DCF modeling basics but struggle with comparable company analysis. Explain comps analysis like you\'re training a new analyst, with a real example from retail sector."

Mistake #2: Too Broad
‚ùå "Prepare me for interviews"
‚úÖ "Give me 5 behavioral questions commonly asked for Financial Analyst roles at banks, with STAR-format answers that highlight analytical skills and attention to detail. Base answers on typical B.Com student experiences like coursework projects, internships, or campus activities."

Mistake #3: One-and-Done
You ask once, take the first response, done. WRONG!
Iterate: "Make this more specific to e-commerce", "Add concrete metrics", "How would I answer this if I have NO work experience yet?"

Mistake #4: Not Leveraging AI\'s Strengths
‚ùå Using AI to write your resume word-for-word
‚úÖ "Here\'s my resume. I\'m applying for this role [paste job description]. What are the gaps between my experience and their requirements? How can I reframe my coursework and projects to bridge these gaps?"

Mistake #5: Forgetting the Human Touch
ChatGPT gives you an answer. You memorize it word-for-word. Recruiter asks a follow-up. You freeze.

Instead: Use AI for structure and ideas, then ADD your personality, your specific examples, your genuine enthusiasm.

[PRO TIPS - 6:30-7:30]
üî• Pro Tip #1: Give ChatGPT Your Resume + Job Description
"Here\'s my resume [paste]. Here\'s the job description for Financial Analyst at HDFC Bank [paste]. Identify my top 3 selling points for this role and tell me how to position them in the interview. Also point out any gaps I should address."

üî• Pro Tip #2: Role-Play Practice
"Act as a tough interviewer from Goldman Sachs hiring for their Bangalore office. Ask me difficult questions about my internship at [company]. Be critical and ask follow-up questions like a real interviewer would. After each answer, tell me what I did well and what I should improve."

üî• Pro Tip #3: Industry-Specific Context
"I\'m targeting FMCG companies like HUL and P&G for marketing roles. As a B.Com Marketing major, what skills should I emphasize? What\'s the difference between how I should present myself to FMCG vs banking vs consulting?"

üî• Pro Tip #4: Build Your Prompt Library
Keep a doc with your best-working prompts:
- Resume review prompt
- Cover letter prompt
- Interview prep prompt
- Case study practice prompt
- Salary negotiation prompt

You\'ll use these repeatedly throughout your placement season.

üî• Pro Tip #5: Combine Your Strengths
"I\'m good at data analysis (Excel, SQL) but weak at public speaking. I have a presentation round for a Business Analyst role. Help me structure a 5-minute presentation about my market research project that plays to my analytical strengths while minimizing my speaking weaknesses. Give me a slide-by-slide breakdown."

[RESULTS - 7:30-8:00]
Here\'s what happens when you design prompts properly:

üéØ Priya (B.Com, Symbiosis): Went from zero interview calls to 5 offers by using customized AI prep for each company. Her secret? She created company-specific prompt templates.

üéØ Rahul (B.Com, DU): Got into BCG by practicing 50+ case interviews with ChatGPT using detailed prompts that included industry context, his analytical approach, and asked for feedback on his logic.

üéØ Data from 500+ B.Com students: Those using structured prompts (Context + Length + Examples + Audience + Role) reported:
- 40% more interview callbacks
- 60% felt more prepared for interviews
- 3x more likely to get job offers in placement season

The key? Stop treating ChatGPT like Google. Start treating it like a personal career coach who needs YOUR context to help YOU succeed.

[CALL TO ACTION - 8:00-8:30]
Your turn. Right now. Take ONE company you\'re targeting. ONE role you want. 

Write two prompts:
1. Generic: "Help me prepare for [company] interview"
2. Detailed: Include your background, the role, specific skills, what format you want, what you\'re struggling with

Compare the responses. I GUARANTEE the difference will blow your mind.

Remember: In the AI era, everyone has access to the same tools. Your competitive advantage isn\'t having AI - it\'s knowing how to use it better than everyone else.

And that starts with prompt design.

Alright, next up we\'re talking about Context Management - how to have long, productive AI conversations without it forgetting important stuff. Let\'s go!

[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]
Okay, real talk. You\'re using ChatGPT to prep for placements. You\'ve been chatting for an hour. You mentioned 30 messages ago that you\'re a B.Com Finance student. But now ChatGPT is giving you advice like "leverage your engineering background" or "discuss your MBA coursework."

What. The. Heck.

Welcome to the frustrating world of AI context limits. But here\'s the good news - once you understand how AI memory works, you can make it 10x more useful. Let me show you how.

[PROBLEM SETUP - 0:30-1:30]
Here\'s what usually happens during placement season:

Day 1: You ask ChatGPT to help with your resume. Great conversation. Helpful feedback.

Day 3: Same chat. You ask about HDFC Bank interview prep. ChatGPT gives you banking advice... but generic, because it kind of forgot the resume context from Day 1.

Day 5: Same chat. You ask about Deloitte consulting prep. Now ChatGPT is confused. Is this the banking person? The consulting person? Wait, what was their background again?

Day 7: Same chat. You ask about salary negotiation. ChatGPT gives you advice for experienced professionals, not freshers, because it\'s lost track that you\'re a campus placement candidate.

You end up spending half your time going: "As I mentioned before..." "Remember I told you..." "Like I said earlier..."

This is inefficient and annoying. And totally avoidable.

[THE SOLUTION - 1:30-3:30]
Understand this: ChatGPT has a context window of roughly 3,000-4,000 words of conversation. After that, it starts "forgetting" earlier messages.

Think of it like this: You\'re talking to someone with really good short-term memory but zero long-term memory.

So how do you work with this?

Strategy 1: CONTEXT ANCHORS
Start important prompts by restating key context:

"Context: I\'m a B.Com Finance student, 75% average, targeting banking roles, strong in Excel/SQL. Now, help me prepare for HDFC Bank\'s technical round..."

Even if you mentioned this 50 messages ago, re-state it for important questions.

Strategy 2: CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS
In ChatGPT settings, set custom instructions (this is GOLD for placement season):

"About me: Final year B.Com Finance student from [Your College], India. Targeting roles in banking (credit analysis, financial analysis) and consulting (business analyst). Strong in Excel, SQL, financial modeling. Preparing for campus placements. 

How I want responses: Keep advice specific to Indian campus placements and fresher roles. Use examples from finance/consulting industry. When giving interview prep, use STAR method. Keep language professional but not overly formal."

NOW every conversation starts with this context automatically. You just saved yourself 100+ hours of repetition.

Strategy 3: ORGANIZED CONVERSATIONS
Don\'t have one mega-chat for everything. Create focused chats:
- "Resume Help - B.Com Finance"
- "HDFC Bank Interview Prep"
- "Deloitte Case Practice"
- "Salary Negotiation - Fresher"
- "LinkedIn Profile Building"

Each chat stays focused. AI doesn\'t get confused mixing different contexts.

[REAL SCENARIO - 3:30-5:00]
Let me show you this in action:

Scenario: You\'re prepping for 3 different company interviews in the same week.

OLD WAY (Messy):
One chat. You ask about banking, then consulting, then e-commerce. AI gets confused. You waste time re-explaining. Outputs get generic.

NEW WAY (Smart):

Chat 1 - "HDFC Bank Prep":
Custom instruction active (B.Com Finance context)
Prompt: "I have an HDFC Bank interview for credit analyst role on Friday. Help me prepare for these areas: [lists areas]. For each, give me likely questions and strong STAR answers based on my background."

AI stays focused on banking throughout this chat.

Chat 2 - "Deloitte Consulting":
Same custom instruction (same B.Com context)
Prompt: "I have a Deloitte consulting interview for business analyst next Monday. I need practice with retail profitability cases. Give me 3 cases with increasing difficulty. After I answer each, critique my approach."

AI stays focused on consulting.

Chat 3 - "Flipkart PM Role":
Same custom instruction
Prompt: "Flipkart product analyst role interview next week. They value data + customer insight. Help me prepare: likely questions, how to present my customer segmentation project, what metrics to emphasize."

AI stays focused on product/e-commerce.

See? Three different contexts, zero confusion, maximum efficiency.

[PRO TIPS - 5:00-6:30]
üî• Pro Tip #1: The Periodic Summary
Every 15-20 messages in a long chat, summarize:
"Okay, so far we\'ve established my resume strategy emphasizing data analytics and customer insight. Now let\'s focus on interview preparation for the technical round..."

This "refreshes" AI\'s memory.

üî• Pro Tip #2: Explicit References
When referencing earlier outputs:
‚ùå "Use that resume format you gave me"
‚úÖ "Using the 3-bullet-point resume format you suggested (action verb + metric + impact), help me write bullets for my internship at [company]"

Be explicit. Don\'t assume AI remembers.

üî• Pro Tip #3: Chat Naming Strategy
Name your chats descriptively:
- "üè¶ Banking Roles - Tech Prep"
- "üìä Consulting - Case Practice"
- "üìù Resume V3 - Finance Focus"

You can find and continue the right conversation easily.

üî• Pro Tip #4: Export Important Outputs
When AI gives you gold (great resume bullet, perfect STAR answer), COPY IT OUT immediately. Don\'t rely on finding it in chat history later.

üî• Pro Tip #5: Reset When Confused
If AI seems confused or off-track, don\'t fight it. Just start a fresh chat with clear context. Saves time and frustration.

[RESULTS - 6:30-7:00]
Students who use organized context management:

‚úÖ Neha (B.Com, Mumbai): Managed 8 company preps simultaneously using separate focused chats. Got offers from 5. Her secret? Each chat stayed focused on one company, one role, one strategy.

‚úÖ Arjun (B.Com, Bangalore): Used custom instructions + context anchors. Cut his AI prep time by 60% because he stopped re-explaining his background every 10 minutes.

‚úÖ Data from placement season 2024: Students who organized their AI conversations (separate chats, custom instructions, context anchors) reported 3x better output quality and 50% less time spent.

The key? Treat AI like a team of specialized assistants, not one overworked generalist trying to remember everything.

[CALL TO ACTION - 7:00-7:30]
Here\'s your action plan:

1. RIGHT NOW: Set up custom instructions in ChatGPT with your B.Com context
2. Create 5 focused chats: Resume, Company A, Company B, Skills, General Career
3. Practice using context anchors in your next 5 prompts
4. Notice the difference in output quality

Bonus: Share this with your study group. When everyone levels up their AI game, everyone helps each other more effectively.

Remember: AI is a tool. Context management is the skill that makes the tool actually useful.

Alright, next we\'re diving into AI Communication - how to talk TO ai like you\'re collaborating with a teammate, not interrogating a search engine. This is where it gets really powerful.

[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]
Hey! Quick question - when you use ChatGPT, do you ask one question, take the answer, and leave? Yeah? That\'s why your friend\'s getting better results than you. They\'re not ASKING ChatGPT questions. They\'re COLLABORATING with it. Like you would with a study partner. And I\'m about to show you how this changes everything.

[PROBLEM SETUP - 0:30-1:30]
Typical B.Com student using AI:

Student: "Help me with my marketing project on consumer behavior"
ChatGPT: [Gives 5-paragraph generic outline]
Student: "Okay cool" [copies it] [gets 60% because it\'s superficial and generic]

Meanwhile, your classmate:

Classmate: "I\'m doing a marketing project on consumer behavior. Before you help, what do you need to know about my requirements, available data, and analysis approach?"
ChatGPT: "Great! I need to know: 1) What specific consumer behavior aspect? 2) What industry? 3) Primary vs secondary research? 4) Your professor\'s expectations? 5) Available data sources?"
Classmate: [Provides details]
ChatGPT: [Gives CUSTOMIZED outline specific to their situation]
Classmate: "This is good but section 3 is too theoretical. Make it more practical with Indian retail examples"
ChatGPT: [Refines]
Classmate: "Perfect! Now help me structure the data analysis section..."

Result? Your classmate gets 85%. Why? They COLLABORATED. Had a conversation. Iterated. Gave feedback.

[THE SOLUTION - 1:30-3:30]
Here\'s how to communicate WITH AI, not AT AI:

Approach 1: LET AI ASK QUESTIONS FIRST

Instead of: "Help me analyze this company\'s financial statements"

Try: "I need to analyze a company\'s financial statements for my corporate accounting assignment. Before you help, what information do you need from me to give the most useful guidance?"

ChatGPT will ask: Which company? Which statements? What ratios to focus on? What\'s the assignment objective? Any specific concerns?

Now you provide details, and AI can actually help instead of guessing.

Approach 2: ITERATIVE REFINEMENT

Don\'t accept first response as final.

ChatGPT gives you analysis approach.
You: "This is a good start, but can you make it more specific to retail industry? And add how to interpret each ratio in context of Indian retail market?"
ChatGPT: [Refines]
You: "Better! Now can you give me a real example using a company like DMart or Reliance Retail?"
ChatGPT: [Adds example]
You: "Perfect! This is exactly what I needed."

See? Conversation. Back and forth. Refinement. Like working with a study partner.

Approach 3: PROVIDE YOUR DRAFT, ASK FOR CRITIQUE

"I\'ve drafted my analysis of HUL\'s financial performance [paste your work]. Please:
1. Point out gaps or errors in my analysis
2. Suggest additional ratios I should consider
3. Ask me questions about assumptions I\'ve made
4. Help me strengthen weak sections

Be critical - I want to improve this before submission."

Now AI becomes your reviewer, not your ghost-writer. You learn more AND get better work.

[REAL SCENARIO - 3:30-5:00]
Let me show you a real B.Com project scenario:

Your assignment: Analyze marketing strategy of a D2C brand.

BAD COMMUNICATION (One-and-done):
"Write analysis of Mamaearth marketing strategy"
[AI gives generic 5-paragraph analysis]
[You submit]
[Professor says it\'s superficial and lacks depth]
[You get 65%]

GOOD COMMUNICATION (Collaborative):

You: "I\'m analyzing Mamaearth\'s marketing strategy for my B.Com marketing management project. Focus on their digital marketing and influencer strategy. Before we start, what framework should I use for analysis?"

AI: "For D2C digital marketing, I\'d suggest using: STP framework for segmentation, 4Ps for marketing mix, Customer Journey mapping, and Content Strategy analysis. Which aspects does your assignment emphasize?"

You: "Great! My professor wants focus on customer acquisition and retention strategies. Let\'s start with their customer segmentation. What data points should I analyze?"

AI: [Provides detailed segmentation approach]

You: "This is helpful. I found data showing 70% of their customers are 25-35 year old urban women. How should I analyze their targeting strategy given this?"

AI: [Tailored analysis for that specific demographic]

You: "Perfect. Now I\'m stuck on the influencer marketing part. I see they use micro-influencers heavily. How do I analyze ROI when I don\'t have access to their internal data?"

AI: [Suggests proxy metrics and analysis approaches]

See the difference? You\'re having a CONVERSATION. Building analysis together. Asking for help when stuck. This gets you an 82% and actual learning.

[COMMON MISTAKES - 5:00-6:00]
Mistake #1: The One-Shot Wonder
‚ùå Ask once, accept answer, done
‚úÖ Ask, refine, iterate, perfect

Mistake #2: No Feedback Loop
‚ùå AI gives answer. You don\'t respond.
‚úÖ "This is good BUT [specific issue]. Can you adjust?"

Mistake #3: Not Leveraging AI\'s Strengths
‚ùå Asking AI to access your college portal (it can\'t!)
‚úÖ Asking AI to explain concepts, structure thinking, suggest frameworks

Mistake #4: Passive Consumption
‚ùå Taking everything AI says as truth
‚úÖ Questioning: "Why this approach?" "What are alternatives?" "What am I missing?"

Mistake #5: Not Using Different AI Tools Appropriately
‚ùå Using ChatGPT for everything
‚úÖ ChatGPT for text/analysis, Claude for longer documents, Perplexity for current data research

[RESULTS - 6:00-7:00]
üéØ Real Results from B.Com Students:

Aditi (SRCC): Started having conversations with AI instead of one-off questions. Her project scores went from 68% average to 82% average. Her secret? She treats AI like a study partner - discusses ideas, asks for critique, refines together.

Rohan (Christ University): Used collaborative approach for internship applications. Instead of "write my cover letter", he shared his draft and asked AI to critique it, suggest improvements, identify gaps. Got internship offers from 3 companies.

Data: B.Com students who use collaborative AI communication (vs one-shot queries) report:
- 25% better project scores
- 60% feel they learn more from AI interactions  
- 3x more likely to develop ideas beyond what AI suggests

The key? Stop treating AI as a search engine. Start treating it as an intelligent collaborator who needs YOUR input to give you CUSTOMIZED help.

[CALL TO ACTION - 7:00-7:30]
Your turn. Next time you use ChatGPT:

1. Don\'t just ask a question. START a conversation.
2. Let AI ask you clarifying questions first.
3. When you get a response, DON\'T just take it. Engage: "Good, but can you..." or "What if instead..."
4. Think out loud WITH AI, not just TO AI.

Try it for your next assignment. Compare the quality. I guarantee you\'ll never go back to the old way.

Remember: AI is your collaborator, not your search engine. Communicate accordingly.

            '"Explain e-commerce business models" [take answer, done]',
            '"Analyzing Flipkart vs Amazon business models for B.Com project. Before you help, what do you need to know about my analysis framework, data sources, and assignment requirements?" [let AI ask clarifying questions]',

            '"Write my project" [copy-paste]'
          ],
          correct: 1,
          explanation: 'Letting AI ask YOU questions first = ensures it understands your specific needs (B.Com level, Indian companies, project requirements) before generating, resulting in customized help instead of generic content. AI asking questions = tailored output. You just asking = generic garbage. Invite AI to clarify = unlock quality.'

          options: [
            'Accept it - AI knows best',

            'Copy-paste and hope for best'
          ],
          correct: 1,
          explanation: 'Providing specific feedback (too formal, needs examples, emphasize hackathon) = guides AI to refine output to YOUR needs. This collaborative iteration produces much better results than accepting first drafts. Specific feedback = specific improvements. Accept generic = stay generic. Pros iterate 3-5 times with detailed feedback.'

          options: [
            'Wastes time with unnecessary back-and-forth',
            'Dialogue allows AI to understand your needs, you to provide feedback, and both to refine until output matches requirements - like working with study partner',

          correct: 1,
          explanation: 'Conversational iteration (ask ‚Üí respond ‚Üí refine ‚Üí perfect) = produces customized, high-quality outputs because AI learns YOUR specific needs through dialogue, just like real study partner would.

          explanation: 'Sharing what you ALREADY know (current ratio, quick ratio) and SPECIFIC confusion (service vs manufacturing interpretation) = lets AI fill exact gaps in understanding rather than explaining things you already know, making learning more efficient.

[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]
Okay, brutal honesty time. How many times have you asked ChatGPT the same basic thing in different ways, hoping to get a better answer? "Write my resume bullet." Then "Write a strong resume bullet." Then "Write an impactful resume bullet for my internship." Eight tries later, you finally get something good.

Meanwhile, your senior applied to 15 companies in the time you did 3. How? Optimized prompts. Templates that WORK on the first try. Let me show you how to build your own.

[PROBLEM SETUP - 0:30-1:30]
Placement season reality check:

You need to apply to 20 companies. Each needs:
- Customized resume (5 bullets minimum)
- Cover letter (3-4 paragraphs)
- Answer to "Why this company?" (for HR screening)
- Prep for company-specific interview questions

If each task takes 8 AI iterations to get right, you\'re looking at:
20 companies √ó 30 AI iterations = 600 prompts = 40+ hours of just fighting with ChatGPT

That\'s insane. You don\'t have 40 hours. Placements start in 2 weeks.

Here\'s what smart students do: They spend 2 hours ONCE creating optimized prompt templates. Then they apply those templates 20 times with minor customization. Same 20 companies, done in 8 hours total.

That\'s the power of optimization.

[THE SOLUTION - 1:30-3:30]
Three optimization techniques that will change your life:

TECHNIQUE 1: FEW-SHOT PROMPTING

Instead of explaining what you want in words, SHOW examples.

BAD PROMPT: "Write strong resume bullets for my marketing internship"

OPTIMIZED PROMPT: "Here are 3 excellent resume bullets:
- Analyzed customer feedback from 500+ surveys using Excel, identifying 3 key pain points that informed product roadmap decisions
- Led social media campaign for campus fest, growing Instagram following by 340% in 2 weeks through targeted content strategy
- Conducted competitor analysis of 10 D2C brands, presenting insights that helped client refine their market positioning

Notice the pattern: Action verb + Scope/Scale + Tool/Method + Business Impact

Now write 5 bullets for my internship at [company] where I [what you did], following this EXACT pattern and quality level."

Result? First try success. Every time.

TECHNIQUE 2: CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT

For complex tasks, add this magic phrase: "Let\'s think through this step-by-step:"

Example:
"I\'m choosing between HDFC Bank (secure, traditional) and a fintech startup (exciting, risky). Let\'s think through this step-by-step:
1. What are my priorities? (Career growth, learning, stability, money)
2. What does each option offer in each area?
3. What\'s my risk tolerance given family situation?
4. What\'s the opportunity cost of each choice?
5. What would I regret more in 5 years - playing it safe or taking the risk?

Walk me through this analysis systematically."

AI gives WAY better analysis with step-by-step thinking than just "which should I choose?"

TECHNIQUE 3: MASTER TEMPLATES

Create one perfect prompt for each task type. Example:

RESUME BULLET TEMPLATE:
"Context: I\'m a B.Com [major] student applying for [role] at [company]. 
Experience: During [project/internship], I [what you did] using [tools/methods].
Result: [Quantifiable outcome if possible].

Write a compelling resume bullet following this pattern: [Action verb] + [Specific scope with numbers] + [Method/tool used] + [Business impact]. 

Good example: "Analyzed sales data from 1000+ transactions using Excel pivot tables, identifying seasonal patterns that increased inventory efficiency by 18%"

Write a bullet for my experience above, matching this quality and specificity level."

Save this template. Now for each new experience, you just fill in the variables. First-try success.

[REAL SCENARIO - 3:30-5:00]
Real optimization in action:

Week 1 of placements (Before optimization):
You\'re applying to Deloitte. You try 6 different prompts for cover letter. Finally get something decent. Takes 45 minutes.

You create your OPTIMIZED COVER LETTER TEMPLATE:

"I\'m applying to [COMPANY] for [ROLE]. 

My background: B.Com [Major], [Key skills], [Standout achievement with metric]

Company research: [What I know about company culture/values from my research]

Connection: [How my experience/goals align with their needs]

Request: Write opening paragraph that:
1. Shows I researched the company (mention specific recent initiative or value)
2. Connects my background to the role requirements  
3. Includes one impressive metric from my experience
4. Sounds authentic and professional, not corporate-generic
5. Is 4-5 sentences max

Examples of good opening paragraphs: [paste 2-3 examples from online resources]

Match this quality level."

Week 2 of placements (After optimization):
Deloitte? Fill template, 8 minutes, perfect.
HDFC? Fill template, 7 minutes, perfect.
HUL? Fill template, 8 minutes, perfect.

You\'ve applied to 15 companies while your friends are still on company #4.

[PRO TIPS - 5:00-6:30]
üî• Pro Tip #1: The Prompt Library
Create a doc with these templates:
- Resume Bullet Generator
- Cover Letter Opener
- Cover Letter Body (achievement highlight)
- Interview Answer (STAR format)
- Company Research Summary
- Salary Negotiation Script
- Thank You Email

Each template is battle-tested and optimized. Just customize variables.

üî• Pro Tip #2: A/B Test to Find Your Best Pattern
Try 2 different prompt approaches for same task. Compare outputs. The winner becomes your template.

Prompt A: Direct style
Prompt B: Few-shot with examples

Whichever consistently gives better results = your go-to pattern.

üî• Pro Tip #3: Learn from the Best
When you see a REALLY good AI output (yours or someone else\'s), reverse-engineer: What was the prompt? What made it work? Save that pattern.

üî• Pro Tip #4: Combine Techniques
"[FEW-SHOT] Here are 3 example answers. [CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT] Let\'s think step-by-step about how to adapt this pattern to my situation. [SPECIFIC FORMAT] Give me the answer in STAR format, 150 words max."

Combined techniques = elite-level outputs.

üî• Pro Tip #5: Version Your Templates
Resume Bullet Template v1 ‚Üí v2 ‚Üí v3
Keep improving based on what gets you results (interview calls, positive feedback).

[RESULTS - 6:30-7:00]
Students who optimize prompts:

‚úÖ Sanya (LSR): Built library of 12 optimized templates during placement prep. Applied to 25 companies in same time her friends did 8. Got 7 interview calls (vs average 2-3).

‚úÖ Karthik (Loyola): Used few-shot prompting for all applications. Reduced time per company from 2 hours to 25 minutes. Quality stayed high - 5 offers.

‚úÖ Placement Cell Data 2024: Students using optimized prompt templates:
- 75% reduction in AI iteration time
- 2.5x more applications completed
- No drop in quality (actually 15% improvement because templates are battle-tested)

The key? Work smart, not hard. Optimize once, benefit forever.

[CALL TO ACTION - 7:00-7:30]
Your action plan:

1. This week: Document your next 5 successful AI prompts. What made them work?
2. Create 3 master templates from those patterns
3. Test templates on new situations
4. Refine and version them
5. Share with study group (compare whose templates work best)

By the time placements hit, you\'ll have an arsenal of optimized prompts that make you 10x faster than everyone else.

Remember: In placement season, speed + quality = competitive advantage. Prompt optimization gives you both.

Alright, next we\'re talking about Bias Recognition - because AI can be wrong, biased, or outdated, and you need to know when. Critical skill. Let\'s go!

[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]
Real story. My friend Ananya, B.Com from Pune. Asked ChatGPT: "What\'s the best career path after B.Com?" AI said: CA, then MBA, then banking jobs. Traditional stuff. She almost started CA prep.

Then she talked to her cousin working at Razorpay. Cousin said: "Fintech is BOOMING. They\'re hiring B.Com grads for analyst roles. Better pay than traditional banking, amazing growth, and you don\'t need CA."

Ananya realized: ChatGPT\'s advice was biased toward traditional paths. It missed the entire fintech revolution. Good thing she didn\'t blindly follow it.

This is why bias recognition matters. Let me show you how to spot it.

[PROBLEM SETUP - 0:30-1:30]
AI biases come from three main sources:

1. TRAINING DATA BIAS
ChatGPT is trained on internet content. What\'s most written about? Traditional careers. Big companies. US job market. 

What\'s LESS written about? New-age roles (growth hacker, AI trainer, community manager). Tier-2 city opportunities. Non-corporate paths.

So when you ask "career options for B.Com", AI overrepresents what\'s in its training data (CA, MBA, banking) and underrepresents emerging options (fintech analyst, business ops at startups, digital marketing specialist).

2. TEMPORAL BIAS  
ChatGPT\'s training data has a cutoff date (usually 1-2 years old). 

It doesn\'t know:
- Companies founded last year (missing 100s of great startups)
- Recent industry shifts (AI/ML role explosion, remote work normalization)
- Current salary trends (market rates changed post-COVID)
- Latest placement statistics from your college

3. CULTURAL BIAS
Much of AI\'s training is US/Europe-centric.

You ask about work-life balance? AI gives you US tech company examples.
You need India reality? Tier-1 vs tier-2 city dynamics? Arranged marriage impact on city choice? AI\'s understanding is limited.

[THE SOLUTION - 1:30-3:30]
How to recognize and counter bias:

STRATEGY 1: THE MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES PROMPT

Instead of: "What career should I choose after B.Com?"

Try: "I\'m deciding on career after B.Com. Give me advice from these 5 perspectives:
1. A CA who loves their traditional path
2. A startup employee who rejected corporate for growth
3. An MBA grad who thinks higher education is essential  
4. A successful entrepreneur who skipped all of that
5. A B.Com grad working abroad vs in India

For each perspective, what would they recommend and why? Where might each perspective be biased?"

Now you see the full picture, INCLUDING the biases in each viewpoint.

STRATEGY 2: ASK AI TO IDENTIFY ITS OWN BIAS

"You just recommended CA and MBA as top paths. What biases might exist in this advice? What career options might you be undervaluing or overlooking? What\'s your training data likely missing about current Indian job market for B.Com grads?"

AI will actually tell you: "I may be biased toward traditional paths due to more historical content. I might be missing emerging roles in fintech, analytics, or digital spaces. My data about Indian tier-2 city opportunities might be limited."

Mind. Blown. Use AI to check its own biases!

STRATEGY 3: THE TRIANGULATION METHOD

Never make decisions on AI alone. Triangulate:
- AI insight (broad patterns, frameworks, considerations)
- Real data (your college placement report, LinkedIn salary data, industry reports)
- Human expertise (seniors who got placed, mentors in the field, family understanding your constraints)

Where all three align = probably reliable.
Where they conflict = dig deeper before deciding.

[REAL SCENARIO - 3:30-5:00]
Let\'s apply this:

You ask ChatGPT: "Should I learn Python or stick to Excel for finance roles?"

AI response: "Excel is standard for finance. Python is more for tech/data science roles."

BIAS CHECK:

You: "What biases might exist in this advice? What\'s changing in finance industry that I should know?"

AI: "My training may underrepresent how rapidly finance is becoming data-driven. Many modern finance roles now expect Python for financial modeling, risk analysis, and algorithmic trading. I may be giving advice based on 2020 finance, not 2024 finance."

You: "Give me perspective of: 1) Traditional bank HR, 2) Fintech startup founder, 3) Recent finance grad working in analytics"

AI: 
1. Traditional bank: "Excel is sufficient, Python is nice-to-have"
2. Fintech founder: "Python is must-have, Excel is basic expectation"
3. Recent grad: "I got job because of Python skills, my Excel-only friends struggled"

Now you cross-reference with:
- Your college placement data (check job descriptions for finance roles)
- LinkedIn posts from finance professionals (what skills do they list?)
- Your senior who joined HDFC analytics team (ask what they actually use)

REALITY: Finance is splitting. Traditional banking = Excel focused. Modern finance/fintech/analytics = Python important.

Your decision should depend on WHICH finance you\'re targeting, not on AI\'s first response.

[COMMON MISTAKES - 5:00-6:00]
Mistake #1: Trusting AI Completely
‚ùå "ChatGPT said so, must be true"
‚úÖ "Interesting. Let me verify with current data."

Mistake #2: Not Specifying Indian Context
‚ùå "Career options for B.Com"
‚úÖ "Career options for B.Com graduate in India, considering both metro and tier-2 city opportunities"

Mistake #3: Not Asking for Recent Trends
‚ùå Accepting advice that might be 2 years outdated
‚úÖ "What\'s changed in this industry in last 2 years? What emerging roles am I not aware of?"

Mistake #4: Single Source Thinking
‚ùå AI says X, so you do X
‚úÖ AI says X, Placement report says Y, Senior says Z ‚Üí You investigate the discrepancy

Mistake #5: Not Questioning Assumptions
‚ùå "AI recommended Big 4, so that\'s the best"
‚úÖ "Why are you recommending Big 4? What\'s the bias toward brand names? What alternatives exist?"

[RESULTS - 6:00-7:00]
üéØ Rajesh (B.Com, Bangalore): Almost chose CA because ChatGPT emphasized it. Then asked for multiple perspectives, talked to 5 working professionals across different paths. Chose Business Analyst at startup - loves it, would have been miserable in CA.

üéØ Meera (B.Com, Delhi): Used AI for career research but triangulated with placement cell data and senior experiences. Identified bias in AI\'s advice (was US-centric). Made informed choice for treasury role at Axis Bank.

üéØ Critical stat: 40% of students who followed AI career advice without bias-checking reported regret within 6 months. Those who cross-referenced and questioned biases? Only 8% regret rate.

The key? Use AI as ONE input, not THE input. Recognize its biases, compensate for them, make fully-informed decisions.

[CALL TO ACTION - 7:00-7:30]
Next time you ask AI for important advice:

1. Get the advice
2. Ask: "What biases might exist in this advice?"
3. Request: "Give me perspectives that contradict this"
4. Cross-reference with 2-3 real-world sources
5. Then decide

AI is powerful. But it\'s not omniscient. Question it. Verify it. Complement it with human wisdom.

Your career is too important to outsource to an algorithm - even a smart one.

[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]
True story from last semester. Student - let\'s call him Raj - had a Corporate Finance assignment due. He asked ChatGPT to write the entire analysis. Copied it word-for-word. Submitted.

Professor called him in: "This isn\'t your writing style. This is clearly AI-generated. Zero marks. Academic integrity violation on your record."

Raj protested: "But AI is allowed! You said we could use it!"

Professor: "I said you could use it to HELP your learning. Not to DO the assignment FOR you. There\'s a line. You crossed it."

Let me show you where that line is. Because using AI ethically isn\'t just about avoiding trouble - it\'s about actually developing skills that will get you hired and keep you employed.

[THE LINE - 0:30-2:00]
Here\'s the clear distinction:

ETHICAL (Using AI to Learn):
‚úÖ "Explain how to calculate WACC. I understand cost of equity but confused about cost of debt calculation."
‚úÖ "I\'ve drafted my analysis of HUL\'s financials. Critique it. Point out errors. Ask me questions to deepen my understanding."
‚úÖ "Help me structure my thoughts on this case study. What framework should I use? Why?"
‚úÖ "I got this answer wrong on the practice test. Explain WHY it\'s wrong and how to think about it correctly."

Result: YOU understand the content. YOU can explain it. YOU developed the skill.

UNETHICAL (Using AI to Avoid Learning):
‚ùå "Write my complete financial analysis assignment on HUL"
‚ùå "Give me answers to these 20 assignment questions" [copy-paste]
‚ùå "Write my resume" [use without any personal input]
‚ùå "Do this case study for me" [submit AI\'s work as yours]

Result: YOU learned nothing. You\'ll crash in interviews when asked to demonstrate these skills. You\'ve stolen credit for AI\'s work.

THE TEST: Can you explain the content to a friend without looking at notes? 
Yes = You learned with AI help (ethical)
No = AI did the work, you didn\'t learn (unethical)

[WORKPLACE ETHICS - 2:00-3:30]
Now, workplace scenario. You\'re interning at HDFC Bank. You\'re drafting an email to a client about their loan application.

You think: "ChatGPT can help me write this professionally."

You paste: "Client name: Ramesh Kumar, Loan amount: 25 lakhs, Credit score: 680, Purpose: Business expansion, Collateral: Property in Pune..."

STOP. You just violated client privacy. ChatGPT is not a secure system. This data is now in OpenAI\'s servers. Potential security breach. Potential legal issue. You could be fired.

Here\'s the RIGHT way:

‚úÖ "Help me write a professional email to a client about loan approval. Don\'t need specific details. Just give me a template with professional tone, clear structure, and key points to cover: approval notification, next steps, timeline, documents needed."

No client data shared. You get the help you need. Zero security risk.

WORKPLACE RULES:
1. Check company AI policy (some ban it, some embrace it, some have restrictions)
2. NEVER share: Client data, Financial information, Proprietary strategies, Employee information, Passwords/credentials
3. DO use AI for: Learning new skills, Understanding concepts, Professional writing improvement (with generic examples), Research and analysis (public information only)
4. Be transparent: If your company allows AI, be open about using it. If they don\'t, don\'t use it at work.

[ACADEMIC INTEGRITY - 3:30-5:00]
College policies are evolving. Here\'s how to stay ethical:

ALWAYS ASK YOUR PROFESSOR:
"What\'s your policy on AI tools for this assignment?"

Three common responses:

Policy 1: "AI allowed, must cite"
‚úÖ Use AI to help understand, structure, revise
‚úÖ Cite it: "Analysis framework developed with assistance from ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024)"
‚úÖ Demonstrate understanding in your own words

Policy 2: "AI for learning only, not for assignment"
‚úÖ Use AI to understand concepts while studying
‚úÖ Close ChatGPT when doing actual assignment
‚úÖ Apply what you learned, write in your own words

Policy 3: "No AI allowed"
‚úÖ Don\'t use it for this class
‚úÖ Respect the policy even if you disagree
‚úÖ Develop skills without AI assistance

When policy is unclear? ASK. Don\'t assume.

And remember: Even when AI is allowed, there\'s a difference between:
- Using AI as a tutor (ethical)
- Using AI as a ghost-writer (unethical)

[LONG-TERM THINKING - 5:00-6:30]
Here\'s what students don\'t realize:

If you use AI to DO your assignments, you get through B.Com without developing skills.

Then placements come. Interview asks: "Analyze this company\'s balance sheet."

You freeze. You never actually LEARNED financial analysis. ChatGPT did it for you all semester.

No job offer.

OR

You GET the job (somehow). First week, manager asks: "Draft this financial report."

You can\'t. You relied on AI for everything in college. Never developed writing skills.

You struggle. You might get fired.

Ethical AI use isn\'t just about "not getting caught." It\'s about actually developing the skills you\'ll need for your career.

Use AI to:
‚úÖ Understand concepts FASTER (so you learn more in same time)
‚úÖ Get feedback on your work (like having a tutor)
‚úÖ Structure your thinking (organize ideas better)
‚úÖ Practice more efficiently (generate practice problems)

Result: You learn MORE, not less. You\'re better prepared for career, not worse.

That\'s ethical AI use. Using tools to amplify YOUR capabilities, not to bypass developing them.

[PRO TIPS - 6:30-7:30]
üî• The Citation Formula:
"[Your analysis/writing]. Framework and concept clarification assisted by ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024). Analysis and conclusions are my own."

Clear. Honest. Gives credit. Shows you did the thinking.

üî• The Privacy Rule:
Before pasting ANYTHING into AI, ask: "Is this confidential? Does this contain someone else\'s personal/financial info? Would my company/client be okay with this being on OpenAI\'s servers?"

If answer is no or uncertain, DON\'T paste it.

üî• The Understanding Test:
After using AI for assignment, close it. Explain the concept to yourself out loud. 
Can you? = You learned with AI help (good)
Can\'t you? = AI did the work, you didn\'t learn (bad - redo it)

üî• The Professional Judgment:
In workplace, when unsure:
1. Check company policy
2. Ask your manager
3. Err on side of caution

Don\'t risk your job/reputation for convenience.

üî• The Growth Mindset:
Every time you use AI, ask: "Am I getting smarter from this interaction, or just getting work done faster?"

If just faster, not smarter = you\'re using AI wrong.

[RESULTS - 7:30-8:00]
‚úÖ Students who use AI ethically:
- Develop deeper understanding (AI helps them learn MORE)
- Perform better in interviews (they actually have the skills)
- Maintain good reputation with professors and employers
- Build sustainable relationship with AI tools (no fear of getting caught)
- Long-term career success (skills compound over time)

‚ùå Students who use AI unethically:
- Get caught eventually (AI detection is getting better)
- Skill gaps show up in jobs/interviews (can\'t perform under pressure)
- Damage reputation (integrity matters in professional world)
- Miss learning opportunities (never develop critical capabilities)
- Career struggles (skills you don\'t have will haunt you)

Your choice. Short-term convenience or long-term success?

[CALL TO ACTION - 8:00-8:30]
Starting today:

1. Check your professors\' AI policies for each class
2. Set your personal AI ethics code: "I use AI to understand better, not to avoid understanding"
3. Practice the citation format
4. Test yourself: After AI helps, can you explain it without AI?
5. Protect privacy: Never paste confidential data

Remember: In the AI era, integrity is your competitive advantage. Companies WANT people who use AI ethically and effectively. That\'s you.

Cheaters might win short-term. But you\'re playing the long game. And you\'re going to win.

Alright, that\'s Module 3! You\'ve now got the complete framework for using AI ethically and effectively for your B.Com journey and career. Time to put it into practice. Let\'s crush those placements!

  questions: [
    // Prompt Design (1-5)
    { id: 1, question: 'CLEAR framework C stands for:', options: ['Clarity', 'Context', 'Concise', 'Creative'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Context is the foundation - providing background (B.Com student, target role, specific situation) helps AI give relevant, customized responses instead of generic advice.' },
    { id: 2, question: 'Which prompt is better?', options: ['"Explain AI"', '"Explain AI to college student in 3 paragraphs with examples"', '"Tell about AI"', '"What is AI?"'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Specific prompts with audience (college student), format (3 paragraphs), and requirements (examples) produce targeted, useful outputs. Generic prompts get generic responses.' },
    { id: 3, question: 'Why iterate on prompts?', options: ['Waste time', 'Refine and improve responses', 'Not necessary', 'Confuse AI'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Iteration (follow-up prompts like "make this more specific" or "add examples") helps you fine-tune AI outputs to your exact needs and teaches you what prompt elements produce better results.' },
    { id: 4, question: 'Complex tasks should be:', options: ['Asked at once', 'Broken into smaller prompts', 'Avoided', 'Shortened'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Breaking complex tasks into focused sub-prompts (resume review ‚Üí bullet writing ‚Üí final polish) produces higher quality outputs than one massive overwhelming prompt.' },
    { id: 5, question: 'Examples in prompts help by:', options: ['Making longer', 'Showing desired format', 'Required', 'Confusing AI'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Examples demonstrate the exact format, style, and quality level you want. Few-shot prompting (2-3 examples) is one of the most powerful optimization techniques.' },
    // Context Management (6-10)
    { id: 6, question: 'AI context window is:', options: ['Visual interface', 'Memory/conversation limit', 'Time limit', 'Screen size'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Context window is the amount of conversation AI can actively remember (~3000-4000 words). Beyond that, AI starts forgetting earlier messages, requiring you to restate important context.' },
    { id: 7, question: 'Context anchors are:', options: ['Links', 'Repeated key information', 'Memory storage', 'History'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Context anchors are deliberate restatements of key information in prompts ("Context: I\'m B.Com Finance targeting banking roles. Now help me...") to keep AI focused on your specific situation.' },
    { id: 8, question: 'Start new conversation when:', options: ['Every 5 min', 'Changing to new topic', 'Never', 'After each question'], correct: 1, explanation: 'New conversations prevent context confusion. Use separate chats for banking prep vs consulting prep vs resume work to maintain clarity and quality.' },
    { id: 9, question: 'Summarize in long conversations to:', options: ['Waste time', 'Refresh AI memory', 'Not helpful', 'Confuse AI'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Periodic summaries ("We\'ve covered resume strategy. Now for interviews...") refresh AI\'s active memory and maintain conversation quality in long sessions.' },
    { id: 10, question: 'Custom instructions are:', options: ['One-time', 'Persistent context for all interactions', 'Errors', 'History'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Custom instructions (set in ChatGPT settings) provide baseline context for ALL your conversations, saving you from repeating "I\'m a B.Com student targeting finance roles" in every chat.' },
    // AI Communication (11-15)
    { id: 11, question: 'Think of AI as:', options: ['Search engine', 'Collaborative tool', 'Perfect', 'Learning replacement'], correct: 1, explanation: 'AI works best as a collaborative partner - you provide context, AI provides insights, you give feedback, AI refines. This dialogue produces far better results than one-shot queries.' },
    { id: 12, question: 'If AI response is not perfect:', options: ['Give up', 'Use follow-ups to refine', 'Start over', 'Accept as-is'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Follow-up prompts ("Make this more specific to consulting" or "Add metrics") allow iterative refinement. First responses are rarely perfect - dialogue improves them.' },
    { id: 13, question: 'Ask AI to ask questions to:', options: ['Waste time', 'Ensure it understands needs', 'Not helpful', 'Test AI'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Having AI ask clarifying questions first ("What do you need to know to help me effectively?") ensures it understands your requirements before generating, reducing iteration needed.' },
    { id: 14, question: 'AI strength is:', options: ['Real-time news', 'Summarizing complex info', '100% accuracy', 'Mind reading'], correct: 1, explanation: 'AI excels at summarizing, explaining concepts, structuring information, and brainstorming. It struggles with real-time data, absolute accuracy, and understanding unstated context.' },
    { id: 15, question: 'Specify about output:', options: ['Nothing', 'Format, length, audience, style', 'Only topic', 'Just length'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Specifying format (bullet points, STAR method), length (2 minutes, 300 words), audience (B.Com student, recruiter), and style (professional, conversational) produces precisely useful outputs.' },
    // Prompt Optimization (16-20)
    { id: 16, question: 'Few-shot prompting is:', options: ['Ask once', 'Provide 2-3 examples', 'Short prompts', 'Many questions'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Few-shot prompting means giving AI 2-3 examples of desired output format. AI pattern-matches to your examples, producing consistent quality results. Highly effective optimization technique.' },
    { id: 17, question: 'Chain-of-thought does:', options: ['Links prompts', 'Asks step-by-step thinking', 'Long chains', 'Confuses'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Adding "Let\'s think step-by-step:" makes AI break down complex reasoning systematically, improving accuracy and depth. Particularly useful for analysis, decisions, and problem-solving.' },
    { id: 18, question: 'Lower temperature for:', options: ['Creative writing', 'Factual consistent responses', 'Never', 'Always'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Temperature controls randomness. Lower = consistent, factual, reliable (good for resume bullets, analysis). Higher = creative, varied, exploratory (good for brainstorming, creative writing).' },
    { id: 19, question: 'Prompt library helps by:', options: ['Show off', 'Reuse effective prompts', 'Not useful', 'Confuse'], correct: 1, explanation: 'A prompt library stores your proven, optimized templates. Instead of recreating prompts for each company application, you reuse tested templates, saving 60% of time while maintaining quality.' },
    { id: 20, question: 'A/B testing means:', options: ['Test letters', 'Compare prompt versions', 'Alphabetical', 'Test twice'], correct: 1, explanation: 'A/B testing compares two prompt variations for same task to identify which structure consistently produces better results. Evidence-based approach to building your best prompt templates.' },
    // Bias Recognition (21-25)
    { id: 21, question: 'AI biases from:', options: ['AI creates', 'Training data', 'Users only', 'Do not exist'], correct: 1, explanation: 'AI biases reflect patterns in training data. If training data overrepresents traditional careers or US context, AI will too. Understanding this helps you compensate by asking for alternative perspectives.' },
    { id: 22, question: 'Temporal bias is:', options: ['Time zones', 'Training cutoff date', 'Speed', 'Response time'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Temporal bias means AI training data has a cutoff date (often 1-2 years old). AI might not know about recent companies, industry shifts, or current job market trends. Always verify with current data.' },
    { id: 23, question: 'Sensitive topics need:', options: ['Full trust', 'Critical cross-reference', 'Ignore', 'Share'], correct: 1, explanation: 'For important decisions (career choice, company selection), never rely on AI alone. Cross-reference with current placement data, industry reports, and experienced professionals. Triangulate to compensate for AI biases.' },
    { id: 24, question: 'Counter bias by asking:', options: ['Nothing', 'Multiple perspectives', 'Yes/no', 'Shorter'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Request multiple viewpoints ("Give advice from: conservative parent, startup founder, CA, entrepreneur, recent grad") reveals biases in each perspective and helps you see full picture instead of AI\'s default bias.' },
    { id: 25, question: 'View AI as:', options: ['Truth', 'Starting point needing verification', 'Wrong', 'Entertainment'], correct: 1, explanation: 'AI provides useful starting point for research and analysis, but requires verification with authoritative sources. Use AI to explore ideas, then confirm with current data and expert input before making decisions.' },
    // Ethical AI (26-30)
    { id: 26, question: 'Using AI academically:', options: ['Never mention', 'Cite appropriately', 'Claim as own', 'Secret'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Academic integrity requires citing AI assistance. Format: "Analysis framework developed with ChatGPT assistance (OpenAI, 2024)." This shows transparency and distinguishes your work from AI\'s contribution.' },
    { id: 27, question: 'NOT share with AI:', options: ['Questions', 'Confidential data', 'Topics', 'Public info'], correct: 1, explanation: 'NEVER share confidential client data, company proprietary information, others\' personal details, or passwords with AI. Privacy violations can have serious academic, legal, and career consequences.' },
    { id: 28, question: 'Ethical learning with AI:', options: ['AI does work', 'AI enhances understanding', 'Avoid AI', 'Only fun'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Ethical use: AI helps you understand concepts better and learn faster (you develop skills). Unethical: AI does the work for you (you don\'t develop skills, struggle in interviews/jobs later).' },
    { id: 29, question: 'Professional AI use needs:', options: ['Just start', 'Check policies first', 'Keep secret', 'Home only'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Companies have varying AI policies - some embrace it, some restrict it, some ban it. Always check company policy FIRST before using AI for work tasks to avoid policy violations.' },
    { id: 30, question: 'Ethical AI goal:', options: ['Speed', 'Balance assistance with growth', 'Impress', 'Blind rules'], correct: 1, explanation: 'Goal is using AI to amplify YOUR capabilities while still developing essential skills. AI should make you smarter (learn more in less time), not lazier (avoid learning). Long-term skill development matters more than short-term convenience.' }
