### SCRIPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM VIDEO GENERATION

---

**INTRODUCTION (0-15 seconds)**
"Okay, so you're probably here because you're tired of falling for fake news, getting confused by conflicting information, or maybe you just want to make better decisions. Good news - critical thinking isn't about being negative, it's about being smart."

**ACADEMIC SCENARIOS (15-90 seconds)**
"College is full of information overload, right? One professor says one thing, another says the opposite. Your textbook says this, but your research shows that. How do you know what to believe?

Here's the thing - critical thinking isn't about doubting everything, it's about asking the right questions. Who said this? Why did they say it? What evidence do they have? What are they not telling me?

Real example: David was writing a research paper on climate change and found sources saying it's not real. Instead of just believing them, he asked: Who funded this research? What's their agenda? What do the majority of climate scientists say? He ended up with a much stronger argument.

Or Maria who was confused about conflicting diet advice online. Instead of following the latest trend, she learned to ask: What's the source? Is this based on one study or many? What do nutrition experts say? Now she makes informed decisions about her health."

**PROFESSIONAL SCENARIOS (90-165 seconds)**
"Now let's talk about the real world. You know how everyone's trying to sell you something? Whether it's a job, a product, or an idea, people want to convince you. Critical thinking helps you see through the BS.

That internship offer that sounds too good to be true? The job interview where they're promising the moon? The networking event where everyone's trying to pitch you something? These are all situations where critical thinking saves you.

The key is learning to separate facts from opinions, evidence from assumptions, and logic from emotion. Ask yourself: What do I actually know? What am I assuming? What's the other side of this story?

Real example: Alex was offered a 'guaranteed' investment opportunity by a family friend. Instead of jumping in, he asked: What's the actual risk? What's the track record? What do independent financial advisors say? He avoided a potential scam."

**PERSONAL SCENARIOS (165-240 seconds)**
"Personal life too. Social media, relationships, major life decisions - critical thinking helps with all of it. Instead of reacting emotionally, you learn to step back and think.

That friend who's always drama? The relationship that's making you miserable? The major life decision that everyone has an opinion about? Critical thinking helps you figure out what's actually best for you.

It's not about being cold or calculating, it's about being intentional. What do I really want? What are the real consequences? What's the best decision for me, not what others think I should do?"

**MODULE PREVIEW (240-285 seconds)**
"In our Critical Thinking module, you'll master the art of asking the right questions. You'll learn how to evaluate sources and spot bias. You'll discover logical reasoning techniques that help you make better decisions. You'll develop the ability to see multiple perspectives on any issue. And you'll become the person who thinks clearly, not just quickly."

**CALL TO ACTION (285-300 seconds)**
"Ready to stop falling for BS and start thinking like a boss? Ready to make decisions you won't regret? Ready to see through the noise and find the truth? Let's sharpen your thinking skills!"
