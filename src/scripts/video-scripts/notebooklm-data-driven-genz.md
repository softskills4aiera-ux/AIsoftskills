### SCRIPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM VIDEO GENERATION

**INTRODUCTION (0-15 seconds)**
"Yo! So you're probably here because you're tired of making decisions based on gut feelings that turn out to be wrong, or maybe you want to actually understand what all that data means. Well, get ready to learn how to make decisions that actually work."

**ACADEMIC SCENARIOS (15-90 seconds)"
"College is full of decisions, right? Which major to choose, which classes to take, which study methods work best for you. Most people just guess, but what if you could make decisions based on actual evidence?

Here's the thing - data isn't just numbers and charts, it's information that helps you understand what's really happening. Instead of just hoping your study method works, you can track what actually works for you.

Real example: David was struggling with his grades until he started tracking his study habits. He discovered that he learned better in 45-minute blocks with 15-minute breaks, and that he retained more when he studied in the morning. His GPA went from 2.8 to 3.6 in one semester.

Or Sarah who was choosing between two majors. Instead of just asking friends, she researched job prospects, salary data, and course requirements. She made an informed decision based on facts, not just feelings."

**PROFESSIONAL SCENARIOS (90-165 seconds)**
"Now let's talk internships and job hunting. You know how everyone's trying to convince you that their company is the best? Data helps you see through the hype.

That internship offer that sounds amazing? The job that promises great opportunities? The company that says they're innovative? Data helps you verify if these claims are actually true.

The key is learning to ask the right questions and find the right information. What's the company's actual performance? What do employees really say about working there? What's the real growth potential?

Real example: Alex was choosing between two internship offers. Instead of just going with the one that sounded cooler, he researched both companies' financial health, employee satisfaction, and growth prospects. He chose the one with better data, and it led to a full-time job."

**PERSONAL SCENARIOS (165-240 seconds)**
"Personal life too. Budgeting, health decisions, relationship choices - data helps with all of it. Instead of just guessing what works, you can track what actually works for you.

That budget that never works? Track your spending and see where your money really goes. That workout routine that's not working? Track your progress and adjust based on what the data shows.

The key is learning to collect the right information and use it to make better decisions. It's about being intentional and evidence-based, not just reactive."

**MODULE PREVIEW (240-285 seconds)**
"In our Data-Driven Decision Making module, you'll master the art of asking the right questions. You'll learn how to collect and analyze data effectively. You'll discover how to spot trends and patterns that others miss. You'll develop the ability to make decisions based on evidence, not just assumptions. And you'll become the person who always makes the right call."

**CALL TO ACTION (285-300 seconds)**
"Ready to stop guessing and start knowing? Ready to make decisions that actually work? Ready to become the person who always has the facts? Let's turn you into a data-driven decision maker!"
