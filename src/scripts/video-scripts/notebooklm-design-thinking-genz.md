# Design Thinking - Gen Z College Student Script

## Duration: 5 Minutes | Format: Single Presenter + Visual Elements

### SCRIPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM VIDEO GENERATION

---

**INTRODUCTION (0-15 seconds)**
"Hey! So you're probably here because you're tired of the same old solutions to the same old problems, or maybe you want to create something that actually matters. Well, get ready to learn the creative superpower that turns you into an innovation machine."

**ACADEMIC SCENARIOS (15-90 seconds)**
"College is full of problems, right? Group projects that never work, presentations that put everyone to sleep, assignments that feel pointless. What if I told you there's a way to approach these problems that actually makes them fun and productive?

Design thinking isn't about being artistic - it's about being human-centered. Instead of jumping to solutions, you start by understanding the real problem and the real people involved.

Real example: Sarah's group project was a disaster until they used design thinking. Instead of just dividing tasks, they asked: Who are we really designing this for? What do they actually need? What's their biggest frustration? They ended up creating something their professor called 'the best project I've seen in 10 years.'

Or Marcus who was struggling with his presentation. Instead of just dumping information, he used design thinking: Who's my audience? What do they care about? How can I make this relevant to them? He got a standing ovation."

**PROFESSIONAL SCENARIOS (90-165 seconds)**
"Now let's talk internships and job hunting. You know that cover letter that sounds like everyone else's? Or that project proposal that gets rejected? Design thinking changes everything.

Instead of just listing your skills, ask: What problem does this company actually have? How can I solve it in a way that's unique to me? What would make them remember me?

The key is empathy - understanding what people really need, not what you think they need. It's about creating solutions that work, not just solutions that look good.

Real example: Jessica was applying for a marketing internship and instead of the usual 'I'm organized and creative,' she said 'I noticed your social media engagement is low. Here's a 3-step plan to increase it by 40% based on what I learned from your target audience.' She got the internship and a paid project."

**PERSONAL SCENARIOS (165-240 seconds)**
"Personal life too. Roommate conflicts, family drama, relationship issues - design thinking helps with all of it. Instead of just reacting, you learn to understand the real problem and create solutions that work for everyone.

That roommate who never cleans? Instead of just getting mad, ask: Why don't they clean? What would make it easier for them? How can we create a system that works for both of us?

It's about being creative, collaborative, and solution-focused. Instead of just complaining about problems, you become the person who fixes them."

**MODULE PREVIEW (240-285 seconds)**
"In our Design Thinking module, you'll master the empathy techniques that help you understand any problem. You'll learn ideation methods that generate breakthrough solutions. You'll discover prototyping approaches that test ideas quickly. You'll develop the creative confidence to tackle any challenge. And you'll become the person who turns problems into opportunities."

**CALL TO ACTION (285-300 seconds)**
"Ready to stop just solving problems and start creating solutions that matter? Ready to become the person who thinks differently and makes a difference? Let's unlock your creative superpower!"
