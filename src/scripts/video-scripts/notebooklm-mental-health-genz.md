### SCRIPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM VIDEO GENERATION

---

**INTRODUCTION (0-15 seconds)**
"Hey, so you're probably here because you're stressed, overwhelmed, or maybe you just want to feel better. Real talk - college is hard, and taking care of yourself isn't selfish, it's essential."

**ACADEMIC SCENARIOS (15-90 seconds)**
"College stress is real, right? Exams, assignments, group projects, the pressure to get good grades, the fear of failing. It's a lot. But here's the thing - you can't perform your best when you're running on empty.

Mental health isn't just about therapy and medication, it's about daily habits that keep you balanced. Getting enough sleep, eating well, taking breaks, managing your time - these aren't luxuries, they're necessities.

Real example: Jessica was pulling all-nighters and living on energy drinks until she had a panic attack during finals. She learned that 7 hours of sleep and regular meals actually made her more productive than 3 hours of sleep and caffeine. Her grades improved and she felt better.

Or Marcus who was so stressed about his major that he couldn't focus on anything. He learned to take 10-minute breaks every hour, go for walks, and talk to friends about his worries. He realized that taking care of himself made him a better student."

**PROFESSIONAL SCENARIOS (90-165 seconds)**
"Now let's talk internships and job hunting. You know how everyone's trying to hustle 24/7? That's not sustainable, and it's not healthy. The most successful people aren't the ones who work the most, they're the ones who work the smartest.

That internship where you're expected to be available 24/7? The job interview where they ask about your work-life balance? The networking event where you're supposed to be 'on' all the time? These are all situations where your mental health matters.

The key is learning to set boundaries and prioritize your well-being. It's about being productive, not just busy. It's about sustainable success, not burnout.

Real example: Alex was working 60-hour weeks at his internship until he realized he was making more mistakes and being less creative. He learned to work smarter, not harder, and his performance actually improved. He got a full-time offer because he was reliable and consistent, not because he worked the most hours."

**PERSONAL SCENARIOS (165-240 seconds)**
"Personal life too. Relationships, family, friends, social media - all of this affects your mental health. It's about finding balance and knowing when to say no.

That friend who's always drama? The family member who's always criticizing your choices? The social media that makes you feel bad about yourself? These are all things you can manage.

The key is learning to protect your energy and surround yourself with people who support you. It's about being intentional about who and what you let into your life."

**MODULE PREVIEW (240-285 seconds)**
"In our Mental & Physical Health module, you'll master stress management techniques that actually work. You'll learn how to build healthy habits that stick. You'll discover how to set boundaries and protect your energy. You'll develop resilience skills that help you bounce back from setbacks. And you'll become the person who thrives, not just survives."

**CALL TO ACTION (285-300 seconds)**
"Ready to stop just surviving and start thriving? Ready to take care of yourself so you can take care of everything else? Ready to build habits that make you feel amazing? Let's prioritize your well-being!"
