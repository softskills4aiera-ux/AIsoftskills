### SCRIPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM VIDEO GENERATION

---

**INTRODUCTION (0-15 seconds)**
"Yo! So you're probably here because ChatGPT gave you some generic garbage when you asked it to help with your essay, or maybe you're tired of getting basic responses when you need something specific. Well, get ready to learn the secret language that makes AI actually work for you."

**ACADEMIC SCENARIOS (15-90 seconds)**
"Let's talk real college problems. You know that research paper that's due tomorrow and you need help brainstorming? Or that coding assignment where you're stuck on a bug? Or maybe you need help understanding a complex concept for your exam?

Here's the thing - most people ask AI like they're talking to a person, but AI needs specific instructions. Instead of 'help me with my essay,' try 'help me create an outline for a 5-page argumentative essay about climate change, including 3 main arguments and counterarguments.'

Real example: Marcus was struggling with his philosophy paper until he learned to prompt AI with context: 'I'm a college sophomore writing about existentialism. Help me understand how Sartre's concept of bad faith applies to modern social media.' Boom - got exactly what he needed.

Or Sarah who was failing her coding class until she learned to ask: 'I'm a beginner Python programmer. Debug this code that's supposed to sort a list but keeps giving me an error. Explain each step.' AI became her personal tutor."

**PROFESSIONAL SCENARIOS (90-165 seconds)**
"Now let's talk internships and job hunting. You know that cover letter that sounds like everyone else's? Or that email to a potential mentor that gets ignored? AI can help, but you need to know how to ask.

Instead of 'write me a cover letter,' try 'write a cover letter for a marketing internship at a tech startup, highlighting my social media management experience and data analysis skills from my business class.'

The key is being specific about context, your level, and what you want. AI doesn't know you're a college student unless you tell it. It doesn't know your experience level unless you specify it.

Real example: Jessica used AI to help with her internship application by prompting: 'I'm a junior psychology major applying for a UX research internship. Help me explain how my research methods class and volunteer work with children makes me qualified for this role.' She got the internship."

**PERSONAL SCENARIOS (165-240 seconds)**
"Personal life too. Maybe you want to learn a new skill, plan a budget, or even get relationship advice. AI can help with all of this, but you need to prompt it right.

Instead of 'help me learn guitar,' try 'I'm a complete beginner with no musical background. Create a 4-week guitar learning plan with daily 30-minute practice sessions, starting with basic chords.'

The more specific you are about your situation, your goals, and what you want, the better AI can help you. It's like having a personal assistant who's really good at following instructions, but only if you give clear ones."

**MODULE PREVIEW (240-285 seconds)**
"In our Prompt Engineering module, you'll master the 5-step prompt framework that gets perfect results every time. You'll learn how to give AI context so it understands your situation. You'll discover iteration strategies that turn good responses into great ones. You'll develop advanced prompting techniques for complex tasks. And you'll become the person who makes AI work like magic."

**CALL TO ACTION (285-300 seconds)**
"Ready to stop getting generic responses and start getting exactly what you need? Ready to make AI your personal study buddy, career coach, and life hack? Let's turn you into a prompt engineering pro!"
