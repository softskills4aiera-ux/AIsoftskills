### SCRIPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM VIDEO GENERATION

---

**INTRODUCTION (0-15 seconds)**
"Okay, real talk. You're probably here because group projects are a nightmare, or maybe you're tired of being the one who does all the work while everyone else slacks off. Well, get ready to learn how to make teamwork actually work."

**ACADEMIC SCENARIOS (15-90 seconds)**
"College group projects are wild, right? You've got the overachiever who wants to do everything, the slacker who never shows up, the control freak who won't let anyone else contribute, and the quiet one who never speaks up. Sound familiar?

Here's the thing - teamwork isn't about everyone being the same, it's about everyone contributing their strengths. The key is understanding different personalities and learning how to work with them, not against them.

Real example: Alex's group was a disaster until they learned to assign roles based on strengths. The overachiever became the project manager, the creative one handled design, the analytical one did research, and the quiet one became the quality checker. Everyone had a role they were good at, and the project was amazing.

Or Sarah who was always stuck doing all the work. Instead of just complaining, she learned to set boundaries and delegate effectively. She became the leader who got everyone involved, not the martyr who did everything alone."

**PROFESSIONAL SCENARIOS (90-165 seconds)**
"Now let's talk internships and jobs. You know how everyone says 'teamwork makes the dream work'? It's true, but only if you know how to do it right.

That internship where you had to work with people from different departments? The project where you had to collaborate with people you've never met? The meeting where everyone had different opinions? These are all teamwork challenges.

The key is learning to communicate effectively, manage conflicts, and build trust. It's about being reliable, supportive, and open to feedback. It's about knowing when to lead and when to follow.

Real example: Marcus was struggling in his internship until he learned to ask for help and offer help. Instead of trying to figure everything out alone, he started collaborating with his colleagues. He became known as the person who made everyone else better, and he got a full-time offer."

**PERSONAL SCENARIOS (165-240 seconds)**
"Personal life too. Roommate situations, friend groups, family dynamics - teamwork skills help with all of it. Instead of just avoiding conflict, you learn to work through it.

That roommate who never cleans? Instead of just getting mad, you learn to have a conversation about expectations and create a system that works for everyone.

The key is learning to communicate your needs while understanding others' needs. It's about finding win-win solutions instead of just winning arguments."

**MODULE PREVIEW (240-285 seconds)**
"In our Teamwork & Collaboration module, you'll master the art of working with different personalities. You'll learn conflict resolution techniques that turn tension into growth. You'll discover how to build trust and create psychological safety. You'll develop leadership skills that inspire others to contribute. And you'll become the person who makes any team better."

**CALL TO ACTION (285-300 seconds)**
"Ready to stop dreading group projects and start making them amazing? Ready to become the person who makes any team better? Ready to turn conflict into collaboration? Let's make teamwork work!"
